# APC-YOLO11n-seg
Timely repair of transverse and longitudinal cracks in asphalt pavement can significantly extend the service life of the highway. Fast and accurate crack detection is the basis of timely pavement crack maintenance. However, existing crack instance segmentation models are typically complex and challenging to deploy on edge devices for real-time detection. This paper proposes a lightweight instance segmentation model: Asphalt Pavement Crack-YOLO11n-seg (APC-YOLO11n-seg).
The code and dataset supporting this study will be made publicly available on 12 December 2025.
